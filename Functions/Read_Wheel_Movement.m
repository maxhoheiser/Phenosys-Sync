function [Final_Position,Overall_Movement]=Read_Wheel_Movement(TTL1,TTL2)
%This function is using the ttls recorded from a rotary encoder and
%translating them to the actual degrees of movement. This particular script
%is done for the specific rotary encoder used in Jian's recording with the
%Phenosys virtual environment.
%%%%%%%%%%%%% Inputs
% TTL1 = From the pin A of the rotor encoder // digital_input_3 from the
%        digitalin.dat

% TTL2 = From the pin B of the rotor encoder // digital_input_3 from the
%        digitalin.dat

%%%%%%%%%%%%% Outputs
% Final_Position = The final angle (positive is Clock wise) on which the
%                  wheel stopped, relative to the initial accounted as 0

% Overall_Movement = All the registered positions after a movement. It is
%                    NOT the movement sample by sample, but just when the
%                    animal moves
